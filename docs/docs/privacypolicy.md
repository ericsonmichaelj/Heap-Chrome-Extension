Heap Analytics Debugger, while used to show logs when events on [heap.io](https://heap.io) were fired, is no in any way affiliated or associated with the company or website [heap.io](https://heap.io). Our goal is just to create a tool that makes it easier to debug analytic logs in heap analytics. This is a non-profit project and our intended goal is just to improve the chrome extension with no other goals in mind.

No information when using the Heap Analytics Debugger is tracked by us. We are unable and unintereted in seeing when you turn it on, what events you track. 

We use Google's Analytics for tracking downloads and uninstallations, impressions, and total Users. We cannot track these analytics to an identifable person. This site also uses google analytics for tracking impressions on the site but we cannot track it to an identifiable person
