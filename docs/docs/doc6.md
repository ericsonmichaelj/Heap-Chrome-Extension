## Logging Event Properties

All Event Properties are listed under the Event group under properties. These can include event properties that are created under `addEventProperties` or event properties that heap analytics adds for you.

## Logging User Properties

Any heap anlyytics logs listed as a `User Property added` will display under `User Info` the `User Properties`. 
**Note:** This does not include an exhaustive list of all User Properties. Nor will these user properties continue to appear in future event calls even though the user properties are still there.
